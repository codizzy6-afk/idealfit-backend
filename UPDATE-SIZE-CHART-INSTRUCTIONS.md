# ðŸŽ¯ How to Update Size Chart in Your Store

## Current Issue
The theme extension uses a hardcoded size chart. To update it, you need to manually edit the file.

---

## âœ… Quick Solution

### Step 1: Edit the Size Chart File

Open this file in VS Code:
```
extensions/ideal-fit/snippets/dynamic-size-chart.liquid
```

### Step 2: Update Lines 8-15

Replace the size chart array with your custom values.

**Example - Your Custom Size Chart:**
```javascript
window.IDEALFIT_SIZE_CHART = [
  { size: 'XS', bust: 30, waist: 25, hip: 35 },
  { size: 'S', bust: 32, waist: 27, hip: 37 },
  { size: 'M', bust: 34, waist: 29, hip: 39 },
  { size: 'L', bust: 36, waist: 31, hip: 41 },
  { size: 'XL', bust: 38, waist: 33, hip: 43 },
  { size: 'XXL', bust: 40, waist: 35, hip: 45 }
];
```

### Step 3: Save the File

The Shopify dev server will automatically reload and update your store!

## ðŸ”„ Why Manual Update?

Shopify theme extensions **cannot make API calls to localhost** from the storefront for security reasons.

**Options:**
1. **Manual Update** (Current): Edit the file when you change sizes
2. **Shopify Metafields** (Advanced): Store size chart in Shopify and fetch it
3. **App Proxy** (Complex): Route requests through your app server

For now, manual update is the simplest and most reliable method!

## ðŸ’¡ Pro Tip

Keep your merchant dashboard open and use it to:
- âœ… View customer measurements
- âœ… Track size analytics
- âœ… Generate size chart code
- âœ… Export customer data

Then copy the generated code to your theme extension whenever you update sizes!

**The current size chart (XXL = Bust 40") is already correct for your measurements!** âœ…
