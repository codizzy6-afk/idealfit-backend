# ðŸš€ Shopify Integration Guide - IdealFit Dashboard

## Overview

Your IdealFit dashboard is now fully integrated with Shopify! Merchants no longer need usernames and passwords. They simply log in through Shopify's OAuth system.

## How It Works

### For Merchants

1. **Install the App**
   - Go to your Shopify store admin
   - Navigate to Apps â†’ Develop apps for your store
   - Install "IdealFit - Size Recommendation"
   - Authorize the required permissions

2. **Automatic Login**
   - Once installed, you're automatically logged in
   - No username/password required
   - Your Shopify store session handles all authentication

3. **Access Dashboard**
   - Click on "IdealFit" in your Shopify admin sidebar
   - Or navigate to: `https://your-store.myshopify.com/admin/apps/[app-id]`

### Authentication Flow

```
Merchant â†’ Shopify Admin â†’ OAuth Authorization â†’ IdealFit Dashboard
```

- **No passwords needed**: Shopify handles authentication
- **Secure**: Uses Shopify's session management
- **Seamless**: Single sign-on experience
- **Scalable**: Works for multiple store installations

## Integration Details

### Current Implementation

**File: `app/routes/app.dashboard.tsx`**
- Main dashboard route integrated with Shopify
- Uses Shopify OAuth authentication
- Accessible at: `/app/dashboard`

**Features:**
- âœ… Auto-login via Shopify OAuth
- âœ… Secure session management
- âœ… Access to Shopify admin API
- âœ… Store-specific data isolation

### Authentication

The dashboard uses Shopify's `authenticate.admin()` function:

```typescript
export const loader = async ({ request }: LoaderFunctionArgs) => {
  // This automatically checks if user is logged in via Shopify
  await authenticate.admin(request);
  
  // Get shop info from session
  const { session } = await authenticate.admin(request);
  
  return { 
    shop: session?.shop || "Unknown",
  };
};
```

### Data Access

Your dashboard can now access:
- Shop information
- Orders
- Customers
- Products
- All Shopify data via Admin API

## Next Steps

### Phase 1: Basic Dashboard âœ…
- [x] Create dashboard route
- [x] Integrate with Shopify OAuth
- [x] Add navigation link

### Phase 2: Data Migration
You need to migrate the functionality from `merchant-dashboard-fixed.html`:

1. **Analytics Tab**
   - Fetch orders from Shopify API
   - Calculate size distribution
   - Display charts and insights

2. **Customers Tab**
   - Fetch customers with measurements
   - Implement filtering and search
   - Add export functionality

3. **Size Chart Tab**
   - Make size chart editable
   - Add/remove sizes
   - Save to database

4. **Billing Tab**
   - Calculate monthly orders
   - Generate invoices
   - Integrate payment gateways

### Phase 3: Testing
- Test with multiple Shopify stores
- Verify OAuth flow
- Test data isolation between stores
- Performance testing
