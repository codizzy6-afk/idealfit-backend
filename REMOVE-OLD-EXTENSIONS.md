## 🎯 Goal
Remove these old/unused blocks from your Shopify theme:
- IdealFit Size Chart
- IdealFit - Size Recommendation (old version)

---

## 📋 Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Access Theme Editor
1. Go to your Shopify admin
2. Navigate to: **Online Store** → **Themes**
3. Click **"Customize"** on your active theme

### Step 2: Find the Old Blocks
1. In the theme editor, you'll see sections on the left
2. Look for:
   - "IdealFit Size Chart"
   - "IdealFit - Size Recommendation"
   - Any blocks with "IdealFit" in the name

### Step 3: Remove the Blocks
For each old block:

**Option A: Delete from Product Template**
1. Click on "Product" in the left sidebar
2. Scroll to find the old IdealFit blocks
3. Hover over the block
4. Click the **"Delete"** icon (trash can) or **"Remove"** button
5. Click **"Save"**

**Option B: Remove Entire App Block Section**
1. If there's a whole section for old extension:
2. Click on the section
3. Click **"Remove section"** at the bottom
4. Click **"Save"**

### Step 4: Verify What's Left
After removing, you should **ONLY** see:
- ✅ **"IdealFit Size Recommender"** (your current working block)

If you see multiple IdealFit blocks, the new one is the one that works!

### Step 5: Test
1. Go to any product page
2. You should see **only ONE** size recommendation form
3. Try submitting measurements
4. Should recommend sizes correctly
5. Should show "Custom Size" for large measurements

✅ **If it works, you're done!**

## 🆘 If You Can't Find the Blocks

3. See what blocks are listed
4. Remove any "IdealFit" blocks that aren't the working one

### Check App Extensions
1. Go to: **Apps** → **Theme app extensions**
2. Look for old/unused extensions
3. If you see old IdealFit extensions, you can unpublish them
4. But **DON'T** delete the current working one!

## 🚀 Next Steps After Removing

While you register domain and PostgreSQL, I recommend:

3. Check the merchant dashboard still loads
4. Verify analytics show data

**Then we'll add PostgreSQL and custom domain!** 🎉
