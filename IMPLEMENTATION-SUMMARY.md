## Technical Implementation

### Authentication Flow
```typescript

export const loader = async ({ request }: LoaderFunctionArgs) => {
  // This automatically checks Shopify session
  await authenticate.admin(request);
  
  // Get shop info from Shopify session
  const { session } = await authenticate.admin(request);
  
  return { 
    shop: session?.shop || "Unknown",
  };
};
```
